Women graduates from USMMA become eligible to join the organization 30 years after graduation. In 2025, we welcome any women who graduated 
between 1978 and 1994 to purchase a Membership and join us at the [Annual Meeting](../annual-meeting). For first-time members, there is a one-time registration
fee of $200. The registration fee is used to cover First10Forward’s administrative costs, ensuring that 100% of the funds from memberships go 
to the [Annual Grant](../annual-grant).

Eligible graduates can also choose to share a single Membership with one or two other eligible graduates. All graduates on the shared the Membership 
can attend the Annual Meeting, and can nominate one Eligible Organization. Shared memberships cast a single vote on which Eligible Organization will receive that year’s Grant.
