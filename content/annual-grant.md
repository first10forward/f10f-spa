## First10Forward Annual Grant

Our organization raises money by selling annual memberships to eligible classes of women graduates from the United States Merchant Marine Academy. All 
money collected from the sales of annual memberships are combined to create a single __Annual Grant__. First10Forward also accepts, with gratitude, 
donations from friends and colleagues who share our passion for helping women and girls achieve their professional goals. We encourage members to 
seek company matching if available. 

Members nominate [Eligible Charitable Organizations](../nomination#eligibility) from their communities that further our mission of supporting women 
and girls pursuing non-traditional careers. The nominating member presents the pitch for their organization at the [Annual Meeting](../annual-meeting). 
After all nominated organizations have been presented, members vote on which one will receive Annual Grant. The Annual Grant is donated *in its 
entirety* to the organization that receives the most votes.
