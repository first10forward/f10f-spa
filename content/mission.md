# _Women Empowering Women to Become Extraordinary_
 
First10Forward is a New Jersey Non-Profit Corporation, whose mission is to advance the professional goals of women and girls pursuing 
non-traditional careers. The organization was founded by a group of women graduates of the United States Merchant Marine 
Academy (Kings Point), who share a sense of gratitude for the life altering, professional and personal opportunities their Kings Point 
education bestowed upon them, at the same time an awareness of the challenges they had to overcome to succeed in a traditionally 
male-dominated industries. Our members share a desire to "pay it forward" to girls and women embarking on similar non-traditional journeys.
 
## What We Do

Each year, we donate an [Annual Grant](../annual-grant) to an Eligible Organization selected based on member votes.
