First10Forward is a non-profit corporation comprised of women graduates from the United States Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) at Kings Point. Kings Point was the first of the five federal service academies to accept women, a full two years before all other federal service academies. When the academy opened its doors to women in 1974, only a small number of brave pioneers joined the Regiment of Midshipmen. Even today, women comprise only about 15% of the student body.

## Our Name

"First10Forward" honors our origins—graduates from the first decade that Kings Point admitted women (1978-1987).

## Pioneers at Sea and Beyond

The pioneering women in the first 10 classes didn't just break barriers at a military institution, but also at sea as professional merchant mariners. Kings Point training included a year at sea navigating global shipping routes or operating and maintaining engines in environments where they rarely encountered other women. They graduated with impressive credentials:

- Marine Transportation and/or Marine Engineering degrees
- Commissions in the U.S. Naval Reserve (or other military branches)
- U.S. Coast Guard licenses to serve as officers on vessels of unlimited tonnage/horsepower in all waters

## Legacy of Achievement

These graduates have charted courses through uncharted waters, reaching the highest ranks in the maritime industry and beyond:
- Ship Captains and Chief Engineers
- Harbor Pilots and Port Engineers
- Military officers across all branches of service
- Professors, executives, lawyers, doctors, and industry leaders, including the first woman president of America's largest shipbuilder and the CEO of one of the largest tanker companies in the world

## Our Origins

Born from a conversation at a 2016 KP golf outing in Las Vegas and formalized during Homecoming that fall, First10Forward represents the trailblazing spirit of women who attended Kings Point in one of the first ten classes to graduate women. In July 2017, fourteen graduates gathered for our first Annual Meeting to define our mission and set our goals. Each year our ranks grow, as women from subsequent graduating classes are invited to join, broadening our perspectives and enhancing our ability to contribute.

## Our Purpose

Today, decades after graduation, we want to leverage our collective wisdom, influence, and resources to make a difference and inspire the next generation of women pursuing non-traditional professional paths. First10Forward exists to financially and spiritually support girls and women pursuing non-traditional professional paths, while celebrating our shared experiences through annual retreats.
